# I2C_Backpack
I2C Backpack based on a 16 bit ADC and Temp sensor.
I created this module to experiment and learn the I2C bus. Parts are pretty simple, as its a few caps, but the main IC's are MCP9801 and MCP3425A0. As of 10/9/2023, this remains to be tested.
My Main goal is to experiment and read a thermocouple based on a few app notes Ive been reading. I want to make sure I have working code before i move to the main project.
